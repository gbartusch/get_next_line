Hallo Codam,
the winter is coming, and the days grow shorter by the hour,
will you be with us in the warmth of shared ambition?
mijn naam is Gina, pleased to meet you on this journey.
Amsterdam ist eine coole Stadt, full of stories and dreams.
Ik vind Codam echt leuk, a place to build, to grow, to connect.
Are you ready for the next project, the next challenge, the next breakthrough?
Life is amazing, a series of code and possibilities.
Willst du dabei sein, Teil von etwas Größerem?
oder nicht?
As the days get colder, and the city wraps itself in a winter chill,
we come together in learning, forging connections that last.
Each line of code, a step towards mastery, a piece of a bigger picture.
In Amsterdam's streets, echoes of ambition fill the air, alive with potential.
Building projects, one by one, until the vision takes form.
We overcome each challenge, though sometimes it takes grit and heart.
From dawn till dusk, a coder’s journey never ends—this is our path.
Will you stay resilient, even when the bugs seem endless?
Or embrace the errors, let them guide you to a deeper understanding?
A future awaits, full of opportunity for those who dare to create.
Keep pushing forward, for Codam’s path is yours to take.
