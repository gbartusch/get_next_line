In the beginning, everything was silent.

Then came the whispers, 
the echoes of ideas yet to form,
like the first brushstrokes on a blank canvas.

One thought at a time,
one step at a time,
a masterpiece took shape.

But life, as it often does,
paused, changed directions,
and left some stories untold.

Where do we go from here?
What lies beyond the horizon?

Questions asked, 
answers sought, 
and still, we move forward.

One more line, just for the test's sake.
